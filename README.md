1. Text drawing idea and parts of code got from **FastColoredTextBox**

	This is not fork of **FastColoredTextBox** because I have not mastered to improve it.
	Honestly, I was trying to introduce several cursors. But it was so difficult for me

2. Idea of text highlighting got from post about **Qutepart/Enki**: http://habrahabr.ru/post/188144/<br/>
Editor uses **Kate** highlighting files (because there are already 200 languages for free)
