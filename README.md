This is not fork of FastColoredTextBox because I have not mastered to improve it.
Honestly, I was trying to introduce several cursors. But it was so difficult for me

2. Idea of text highlighting got from post about Qutepart/Enki: http://habrahabr.ru/post/188144/
Editor uses Kate highlighting files (because there are already 200 languages for free)
